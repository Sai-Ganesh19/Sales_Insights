  - `FactSales` (date_key, market_key, customer_key, product_key, qty, revenue, cost)
- **Dimensions**
  - `DimDate` (date, month, quarter, year, fiscal)
  - `DimMarket` (market, region, zone)

## üìê Core DAX Measures (Examples)
> Adjust table/column names to match your model.

```DAX
Revenue := SUM(FactSales[revenue])

Cost := SUM(FactSales[cost])

Profit := [Revenue] - [Cost]

Profit Margin % := DIVIDE([Profit], [Revenue])

Sales Qty := SUM(FactSales[qty])

Revenue LY := CALCULATE([Revenue], DATEADD(DimDate[Date], -1, YEAR))

Profit Contribution % :=
DIVIDE([Profit], CALCULATE([Profit], ALL(DimMarket), ALL(DimCustomer)))

Top Customer Revenue % :=
VAR TotalRev = CALCULATE([Revenue], ALL(DimCustomer))
RETURN DIVIDE([Revenue], TotalRev)

Market Rank by Revenue :=
RANKX(ALL(DimMarket[Market]), [Revenue], , DESC)
